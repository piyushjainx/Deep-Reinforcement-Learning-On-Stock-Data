# Project Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Stock Trading

# Situation:
 I undertook a challenging project focused on implementing advanced deep reinforcement learning techniques for stock trading.

# Task:
- The primary responsibilities included designing and training deep reinforcement learning models (DRL), specifically Deep Q-Network (DQN), Double DQN, and Dueling Double DQN.
- I worked with historical stock market data to develop custom trading environments and create a suitable dataset for training the models.
- The goal was to build intelligent trading agents capable of making buy, sell, or hold decisions based on historical market patterns and maximize profits.

# Action:
- Begin with importing essential libraries such as Chainer, NumPy, Pandas, and Plotly for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.
- Loaded historical stock data, preprocessed it, and divided it into training and test sets using a specified date split.
- Created custom trading environments, defined the rules, and implemented the core logic for the reinforcement learning agents.
- Using Chainer, designed and trained Deep Q-Networks, Double DQN, and Dueling Double DQN models, each with different architectural variations.
- Extensive hyperparameter tuning, model optimization, and careful handling of rewards were necessary to improve the models' performance.
- Also monitored and visualized the training progress, including loss and reward plots, to assess the models' convergence and effectiveness.

# Result:
- The project yielded significant outcomes, including:
  - Successful implementation and training of advanced deep reinforcement learning models for stock trading.
  - Improved trading strategies that outperformed traditional methods in backtesting and simulation.
  - Valuable insights into the application of deep reinforcement learning in the financial domain.
  
# Key Achievements:
- Developed and fine-tuned Deep Q-Network (DQN), Double DQN, and Dueling Double DQN models for stock trading.
- Profits generated in both training and test environments, demonstrating the models' ability to make profitable trading decisions.
- Leveraged expertise in data preprocessing, reinforcement learning, and model optimization to drive project success.

# Skills Demonstrated:
- Deep learning and reinforcement learning expertise.
- Data preprocessing, analysis, and custom dataset creation.
- Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and optimization.
- Proficiency in Python programming and relevant libraries (Chainer, NumPy, pandas, Plotly).
- Problem-solving, critical thinking, and project management skills.

This project not only enhanced my technical abilities but also demonstrated my capacity to tackle complex challenges in the domain of deep reinforcement learning and finance.
